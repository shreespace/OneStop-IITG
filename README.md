# OneStop-IITG : User Experience Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation
This repository contains a detailed user experience (UX) analysis and heuristic evaluation of the OneStop IITG mobile application. The goal of this study is to identify usability challenges, customer pain points, and design inefficiencies in the app, along with actionable recommendations for improvement.

#Overview
The OneStop IITG app aims to provide a centralized platform for students of IIT Guwahati to manage schedules, notifications, and campus-related activities. However, its current design and usability pose significant barriers to an intuitive and seamless user experience. This analysis addresses those issues and suggests practical improvements.

#Key Features of the Analysis
**Customer Pain Points**: Lack of clarity in information about app features, event details, and value propositions.
**Usability Issues**: Cluttered interface, inconsistent visual hierarchy, confusing layout, and lack of intuitive controls.
**Information Architecture**: Inconsistent naming conventions, poor searchability, and limited categorization clarity.
**Visual Design Challenges**: Overuse of colors, insufficient whitespace, and unclear font hierarchy.
#Heuristic Evaluation
The evaluation is based on Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics and covers:

1.Visibility of system status/n
2.Match between system and the real world
3.User control and freedom
4.Consistency and standards
5.Error prevention
6.Recognition rather than recall
7.Flexibility and efficiency of use
8.Aesthetic and minimalist design
#Proposed Recommendations
Improved navigation, information hierarchy, and visual design for better usability.
Enhanced accessibility through intuitive controls, clear terminology, and actionable feedback.
Redesign of critical screens (e.g., schedules, notifications, login) to address layout clutter and improve focus.
#Why This Analysis Matters
By addressing the identified pain points, OneStop IITG can transform into a more user-friendly and efficient platform, ultimately improving student engagement and satisfaction.
